## Reference

* [cookbook](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Formula-Cookbook.md)
* [4.02.3](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/ebc3d5bec8b74cb90452fe818ad33d127ebccdd6/Formula)

## Note

* Since 4.03, [OCamlbuild](https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild) is distributed seperately, so `brew install opam` then `brew install ocaml` should kindly emit the `ocamlbuild` confiliction because opam@1.2.2 is dependent on ocamlbuild.
